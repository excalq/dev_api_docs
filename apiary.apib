--- GoWatchIt Developers API v1 ---
---
This API provides access to Go WatchIts database of movies, and
information about movie availability. Availibility information is available
for formats such as DVD rentals, online streaming, theaters, and outdoor screenings.
This API also provides links to watch, rent, or purchase movies online through
WatchIt's partners.

This API is new and currently supports the following features:

* Search by Movie Title

* Retreiving Availability Information.
    Availabilities are data sets describing which providers (e.g. Netflix) currently offer the movie, and in what formats (SD, HD, etc.). They also give a URL to each provider's version of the movie)

For access to this API, you'll need an API key, available from info@gowatchit.com.

To use this API, perform GET requests to the "search" and "availabilities" actions of this controller. See documentation below.

All results are returned in JSON format.

Search
The following resources explain how to search for a GoWatchIt ID. You need to determine a GoWatchitId to do anything useful with the API.
An API user will search for a term with this method, sending a URL as a GET request. The general usage is as follows:  
    
    /api/{API-KEY}/search/{FIELD}/{TOKEN}

- FIELD The field to search. Currently, only "title" is supported.
- TOKEN A search term. Movies (fully/partially) matching this term will be found.
- JSON formatted array of movies which match the search term. Each movie is an object with {id, mrqe_id, title, year}
  
Search for a movie by its title
Using full or partial matches, this action will find movies with similar titles to the term given. 
Many titles match more than one movie, as is the case with sequels and remakes. 
These results provide a unique movie id for each matching title. This movie id is then useful for other API actions.

Availabilities
An API user will supply the id of a movie, and this method will return a JSON object describing
where this movie can be watched or ordered, as well as what formats and prices are available.
Using a movie id obtained from the search method of the API, an availability request is made:

    /api/{API-KEY}/availabilities/{MOVIE-ID}

- MOVIE-ID ID of the movie to fetch availability information about.

Returns a JSON object with categories as object keys, and providers, such as iTunes as the values.
Each provider will contain an array of available movie formats, such as SD, HD, Rent, Buy, and so forth.
